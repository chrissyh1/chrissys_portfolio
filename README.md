# Project 1 
SQL Window Functions & Advanced Queries (4-Part Project)
This repository contains a four-part SQL project designed to strengthen skills in window functions, aggregate calculations, and complex SQL queries. This project was completed as part of a General Assembly program, providing hands-on experience with real-world data analysis scenarios commonly used in financial modeling, business intelligence, and data analysis.

Project Overview
The project is divided into four distinct parts, each progressively building upon previous lessons and concepts to tackle increasingly complex SQL problems:

Part 1: Basic Aggregations & Joins
Introduction to SQL SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT() functions

Using JOIN operations to combine multiple data tables

Filtering and grouping data with GROUP BY and `HAVING

Part 2: Advanced Aggregations & Subqueries
Advanced queries using nested subqueries

Implementing conditional logic with CASE statements

Using RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER() for ranked data [Link to SQL Query Part 2](https://github.com/christiiineh/chrissys_portfolio/blob/main/SQL_Ladder_Challenge_PT%202.sql)

Part 3: Window Functions & Time-Based Analysis
Introduction to window functions: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER(), ROW_NUMBER()

Calculating moving averages and cumulative sums for time series data

Financial trend indicators: Williams %R and Stochastic Oscillator

Monthly revenue tracking using PARTITION BY in window functions [Link to SQL Query Part 3](https://github.com/christiiineh/chrissys_portfolio/blob/main/sql_ladder_challenge_pt3.sql)

Part 4: Complex Aggregation with Business Context
Performing advanced aggregation on stock market data for the Yum! stock

Merging financial data with transactions to derive key business insights

Generating monthly summary reports on stock performance, including high, low, and closing prices, and total volume [Link to SQL Query Part 4](https://github.com/christiiineh/chrissys_portfolio/blob/main/sql_ladder_challenge_pt4.sql)
